👋 hi, i’m dina (@dinablachman) — studying cs + philosophy at barnard  
🧠 i care about thoughtful + creative tech: human–AI collaboration, alignment, legal/ethical AI  
🔍 current work: fine-tuning an LLM to detect prosecutorial misconduct under Prof. Muresan (SRI 2025)  

🛠️ this summer, i'm building:

**whensday** → a tool that scans your texts/emails for intent (e.g. “i’ll do it tmr”) and auto-adds tasks to Google Calendar. all client-side, no data ever stored or shared  
_stack: Python (spaCy, regex), Google Calendar API, Flask_

**giffuse** → a browser tool to stitch Tumblr gifs + TikTok audio into mp4s — like iMovie for nostalgic fan edits  
_stack: React, TypeScript, ffmpeg.wasm, Tailwind_

**ghostfeed** → a Wayback Machine-powered site that 'revives' suspended/deleted Twitter accounts using archived snapshots  
_stack: Node.js, Cheerio, Wayback Machine API_

**personal blog** → just for fun!
_stack: pure HTML, CSS, vanilla JS_

🧃 outside of code: i love journaling, making edits, and going on nyc coffee crawls
